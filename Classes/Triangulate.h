// ** THIS IS A CODE SNIPPET WHICH WILL EFFICIEINTLY TRIANGULATE ANY
// ** POLYGON/CONTOUR (without holes) AS A STATIC CLASS.  THIS SNIPPET
// ** IS COMPRISED OF 3 FILES, TRIANGULATE.H, THE HEADER FILE FOR THE
// ** TRIANGULATE BASE CLASS, TRIANGULATE.CPP, THE IMPLEMENTATION OF
// ** THE TRIANGULATE BASE CLASS, AND TEST.CPP, A SMALL TEST PROGRAM
// ** DEMONSTRATING THE USAGE OF THE TRIANGULATOR.  THE TRIANGULATE
// ** BASE CLASS ALSO PROVIDES TWO USEFUL HELPER METHODS, ONE WHICH
// ** COMPUTES THE AREA OF A POLYGON, AND ANOTHER WHICH DOES AN EFFICENT
// ** POINT IN A TRIANGLE TEST.
